### Network Analysis
```javascript
async function checkDNSLeaks() {
    // Multi-layer DNS leak detection
    const checks = await Promise.all([
        checkSystemDNS(),
        checkWebRTCLeaks(),
        checkMultipleDNSServers()
    ]);
    return !checks.some(result => result === true);
}
```

### Monitoring System
- 5-second intervals for IP monitoring
